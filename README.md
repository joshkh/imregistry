# imRegistry

[InterMine](https://www.intermine.org), a biological data discovery and warehouse tool, affords cross communication between instances of itself, often connecting model organisms via homologous genes. 

imRegistry is the official registrar and source-of-record for mines whose administrators have volunteered to participate in the InterMine federation.
